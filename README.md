Here be some researchy things (read: unsupported, potentially messy, use at your own risk).

### dependencies:

* [`pyaudio`](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)
* [`libo`](https://github.com/CNMAT/libo/tree/libopy) -- needs the `libopy` branch
* [`odot`](https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-odot) to run visualization clients in Max
* more coming soon 

to use `libopy`, edit `odotsetup` to point `sys.path` to the correct path on your system
